# Contributing to GPT-PR

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to GPT-PR! Your contributions can help our project grow and improve. This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Project

Start by forking the GPT-PR repository so you can make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Clone the Repository

After forking, clone the repository to your local machine by replacing `<Your Username>` with your GitHub username in the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<Your Username>/gpt-pr.git
```

### 3. Create a New Branch

Before making changes, create a new branch with the following command:

```
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Please use a descriptive name for your branch.

## Making Changes

Make your changes to the new branch. Be sure to:
- Keep your changes focused and related to a single issue.
- Follow the existing code style.
- Add comments to your code where necessary.

## Committing Your Changes

Once you've made your changes, it's time to commit them. We follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

Stage your changes with `git add .` and then commit them with `git commit -m 'commit message'`. Be sure to write a good commit message that explains the changes you've made following the Angular commit message conventions.

## Submitting a Pull Request

After committing your changes, you're ready to create a pull request (PR):
1. Push your branch to your fork with `git push origin <branch-name>`
2. Then navigate to your GitHub profile and click 'New Pull Request' next to your GPT-PR repository.
3. Ensure that the base repository is the original GPT-PR repository, and the head repository is your fork.
4. Write a clear title and description for your PR outlining the changes you made.

## Conclusion

We'll review your PR as soon as we can. We may suggest changes or improvements. Once your PR has been approved and merged, your changes will be incorporated into the main project.

We're happy to have you here and look forward to your contributions! Remember, everyone is expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing to this project.
